# Customer Churn Prediction System

## Overview
Customer retention is crucial for businesses, and understanding why customers leave (churn) can help companies take proactive measures. This project uses **machine learning** to predict customer churn, allowing businesses to **identify at-risk customers** and implement retention strategies before they leave.

## Impact
- **Reduces Revenue Loss:** Identifies customers who are likely to churn, helping businesses take preventive actions.
- **Optimizes Marketing Efforts:** Enables targeted marketing campaigns to retain high-risk customers.
- **Enhances Customer Experience:** Businesses can improve services based on churn patterns.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Uses ML models to analyze behavioral trends and retention patterns.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model** â€“ A trained model to predict churn based on customer data.
- **Web Application** â€“ A Flask-based UI for uploading customer details and receiving churn predictions.
- **Pre-trained Model** â€“ Uses a pre-optimized `joblib` model for fast predictions.
- **Scalable Design** â€“ Can be adapted for different industries (e.g., telecom, banking, SaaS, etc.).
- **User-Friendly Interface** â€“ Simple input fields and prediction visualization.
